        <h3>Hey! I am here to share my experiences!</h3>
        <p>Since young, I have always been passionate about the aviation industry and hope to experience as much as I can, with a dream of becoming a pilot. This motivated me to pursue a degree in Aviation (Management) in the University of New South Wales, Sydney.
        Since 18 years of age, I have worked in various roles to progress my professional career whilst studying. In July 2023, I was thrilled and over the roof to get my first job with Regional Express. From September 2023, I am now working in one of the worlds leading airlines - Qantas Airways in the Sales & Distribution team alongside my studies.
        Growing up training swimming 40 hours a week and representing Brunei in multiple international competitions, I have learnt the importance of discipline and hardwork to achieve my career goals.

            <p>I studied in Jerudong International Schol (school) from 2013 to 2018 where I completed my IGCSEs. Throughout my time, I have completed the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze and Silver Award where I developed team working skills and organisational skills.<br><br>
                Whilst studying, I was training and competing internationally for Brunei in swimming (you can ready about it <a href="sports">here.</a>). I also further accomplished my grade 7 piano and grade 8 saxophone here. With my musical accomplishments, I was fortunate to
                get selected to represent the school band and jazz band where I got to be creative with my music.<br><br>

            <p>In 2018, I decided to further develop my swimming with Plymouth Leander alongside my A-levels - a professional swimming club that have brought up olympic medalists such as Tom Daley, Ben Proud and Rūta Meilutytė (you can ready about it <a href="sports">here.</a>).

            <p>After taking a gap year to experience the corperate world during COVID, I chose to further pursue my interest in Aviation through doing the Bachelors of Aviation (Management) in 2022.
                <br><br>
                Throughout my time here, I have learnt more about the industry through professionals. My knowledge of the aviation industry has grown exponentially. In 2023, I was fortunate to earn my first position in the aviation industry in Regional Express, before moving on to Qantas (which you can read about it <a href="portfolio">here.</a>).
                I have also earned valuable skill sets and awards such as the UNSW leadersip foundation awards. Being able to work with like-minded professioanals have motivated and reinforced my decision for a career in aviation.<br><br>

            <span><h3>National Swimmer</h3></span>
            <p>
            From young, I was never the best in swimming. In fact, I use to be one of the worse competitors who would always come last. During my first ever swimming competition, when I was around 10, I was sat waiting outside for half a day for a 30 second race while the better ones were out competing. 
            I lost all motivation after that day but good friends and family encouraged me to continue, hence, I did training outside school, training around 40 hours per week. As I progressed, I see my rankings get closer to 1 every competition I did. 
            <br><br>I eventually got selected to represent Brunei in the ASEAN School Games where I competed in the 50m, 100m, 200m breastroke and 200m freestyle and 800m freestyle relay. As I trained further, I got selected to respresent Brunei in multiple international competitions.
            In 2018, I left to the UK to train under one of the best swimming clubs in the world, Plymouth Leander. I stopped swimming competitively in 2020, where I chose to focus on my professional life.<br><br>
            The most important thing I've taken away from my years of swimming is discipline and organisation is the key to success. I was fortunate to have friends and family supporting me, but also had the correct mindset when things got tough.

            <h2 class="heading">Cycling</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>I still remember when I was watching the Tour de France in 2017, it still amazes me how these athletes can race for hours daily with minimal rest. I got my first road bike in 2017, and was fortunate to be part of a team in Brunei that taught me from 0. 
                I use to ride with them 3-4 times a week whilst balancing my swimming training and school work.<br><br>
                In 2018, I attended my first ever cycling race which consists of a circuit of 40km. Through dedication, hardwork and supportive team members, I placed 2nd in the under 25 category. A few months past and I competed in my longest competition yet, 110km - Which I placed 6th in the open category.
                For the rest of the time, I participated in various cycling competitions within Brunei.
                My first international cycling competition was held in Miri, Malaysia - where it was my longest competition of 120km (3 hours), which I placed 6th in the under 25 category. 
                <br><br>
                During my cycling time, I learnt the importance of self care and nutrition to support the demands of my body, as well as teamworking skills.<br><br>

            <h2 class="heading">Triathlon</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>During my time with competitive cycling and swimming, I eventually got into triathlon. Training all 3 sports in a week kept me motivated through having variety in my training. I did not really have a coach or a training program, hence everything in triathlon was self trained / taught.
            <br><br>
             With me being super competitive, I decided to join my first triathlon competition (Panaga Triathlon) in Brunei where I placed first place in the sprint distance in the open category. This gave me more motivation as I felt a potential for myself to be better.
             As I trained and competed further, I signed up to the largest triathlon competition in Brunei in the open age group for the olympic distance. I placed 3rd place for this and made the decision to challenge myself further.
             <br><br>
             In 2020, when COVID-19 was at it's peak, I challenged myself to do an indoor half-ironman, where I completed it in around 6 hours. The biggest lesson I took from my experience is mindset is crucial in any challenge or goal I've set myself. I try to stay positive and try something new every day.<br><br>

            <h2 class="heading">Running</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>During the peak of COVID, I started a personal project improving my running as well as helping with COVID.
            <br><br>
             I challenged myself to run a half-marathon (21.1km) for 7-days straight. I managed to raise over $1000 through donations and support via organic marketing and donated it to the COVID fun relief.

            <h2 class="heading">Crossfit</h2><br><br>
            <span><h3></h3></span>
            <p>
            Interestingly enough, I actually started wwith crossfit before any other sport. My dad brought me to a crossfit gym (Reebok Crossfit 673) based in Brunei, where I was taught my a CrossFit Games Athlete (Michael Mogard).
            <br><br>I trained casually 2 or 3 times a week, but never expected myself to compete in this sport. Until when I was 14, where my gym teammates convinced me to compete in the CrossFit open.
            <br><br>
            Going into this, I did not expect to place well as I was still focused on my swimming. However, I surprised myself and placed 1st place in Brunei and 2nd in South East Asia in the teenage 14-15 year old category. 
            I did more CrossFit opens throughout the year to track where I stand internationally but never fully committed to the sport.<br><br>
            Until this day, I still do CrossFit and the aspect I appreciate the most, is the supportiveness that I get from my teammates and like-minded athletes.<br><br>
