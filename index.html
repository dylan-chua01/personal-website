        <h3>Hey! I am here to share my experiences!</h3>
        <p>Since young, I have always been passionate about the aviation industry and hope to experience as much as I can, with a dream of becoming a pilot. This motivated me to pursue a degree in Aviation (Management) in the University of New South Wales, Sydney.
        Since 18 years of age, I have worked in various roles to progress my professional career whilst studying. In July 2023, I was thrilled and over the roof to get my first job with Regional Express. From September 2023, I am now working in one of the worlds leading airlines - Qantas Airways in the Sales & Distribution team alongside my studies.
        Growing up training swimming 40 hours a week and representing Brunei in multiple international competitions, I have learnt the importance of discipline and hardwork to achieve my career goals.

            <span><h3>National Swimmer</h3></span>
            <p>
            From young, I was never the best in swimming. In fact, I use to be one of the worse competitors who would always come last. During my first ever swimming competition, when I was around 10, I was sat waiting outside for half a day for a 30 second race while the better ones were out competing. 
            I lost all motivation after that day but good friends and family encouraged me to continue, hence, I did training outside school, training around 40 hours per week. As I progressed, I see my rankings get closer to 1 every competition I did. 
            <br><br>I eventually got selected to represent Brunei in the ASEAN School Games where I competed in the 50m, 100m, 200m breastroke and 200m freestyle and 800m freestyle relay. As I trained further, I got selected to respresent Brunei in multiple international competitions.
            In 2018, I left to the UK to train under one of the best swimming clubs in the world, Plymouth Leander. I stopped swimming competitively in 2020, where I chose to focus on my professional life.<br><br>
            The most important thing I've taken away from my years of swimming is discipline and organisation is the key to success. I was fortunate to have friends and family supporting me, but also had the correct mindset when things got tough.

            <h2 class="heading">Cycling</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>I still remember when I was watching the Tour de France in 2017, it still amazes me how these athletes can race for hours daily with minimal rest. I got my first road bike in 2017, and was fortunate to be part of a team in Brunei that taught me from 0. 
                I use to ride with them 3-4 times a week whilst balancing my swimming training and school work.<br><br>
                In 2018, I attended my first ever cycling race which consists of a circuit of 40km. Through dedication, hardwork and supportive team members, I placed 2nd in the under 25 category. A few months past and I competed in my longest competition yet, 110km - Which I placed 6th in the open category.
                For the rest of the time, I participated in various cycling competitions within Brunei.
                My first international cycling competition was held in Miri, Malaysia - where it was my longest competition of 120km (3 hours), which I placed 6th in the under 25 category. 
                <br><br>
                During my cycling time, I learnt the importance of self care and nutrition to support the demands of my body, as well as teamworking skills.<br><br>

            <h2 class="heading">Triathlon</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>During my time with competitive cycling and swimming, I eventually got into triathlon. Training all 3 sports in a week kept me motivated through having variety in my training. I did not really have a coach or a training program, hence everything in triathlon was self trained / taught.
            <br><br>
             With me being super competitive, I decided to join my first triathlon competition (Panaga Triathlon) in Brunei where I placed first place in the sprint distance in the open category. This gave me more motivation as I felt a potential for myself to be better.
             As I trained and competed further, I signed up to the largest triathlon competition in Brunei in the open age group for the olympic distance. I placed 3rd place for this and made the decision to challenge myself further.
             <br><br>
             In 2020, when COVID-19 was at it's peak, I challenged myself to do an indoor half-ironman, where I completed it in around 6 hours. The biggest lesson I took from my experience is mindset is crucial in any challenge or goal I've set myself. I try to stay positive and try something new every day.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2 class="heading">Running</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>During the peak of COVID, I started a personal project improving my running as well as helping with COVID.
            <br><br>
             I challenged myself to run a half-marathon (21.1km) for 7-days straight. I managed to raise over $1000 through donations and support via organic marketing and donated it to the COVID fun relief.

            <h2 class="heading">Crossfit</h2><br><br>
            <span><h3></h3></span>
            <p>
            Interestingly enough, I actually started wwith crossfit before any other sport. My dad brought me to a crossfit gym (Reebok Crossfit 673) based in Brunei, where I was taught my a CrossFit Games Athlete (Michael Mogard).
            <br><br>I trained casually 2 or 3 times a week, but never expected myself to compete in this sport. Until when I was 14, where my gym teammates convinced me to compete in the CrossFit open.
            <br><br>
            Going into this, I did not expect to place well as I was still focused on my swimming. However, I surprised myself and placed 1st place in Brunei and 2nd in South East Asia in the teenage 14-15 year old category. 
            I did more CrossFit opens throughout the year to track where I stand internationally but never fully committed to the sport.<br><br>
            Until this day, I still do CrossFit and the aspect I appreciate the most, is the supportiveness that I get from my teammates and like-minded athletes.

                <h3>Research and Development</h3><br><br>
                <p>During my gap year in 2020, I was fortunate enough to get a job in Globex Global Logistics as my first corporate job. I initially started in the finance department, working with corporate cash flows. 
                    I was trained and used systems such as Quickbooks on a daily basis. This department taught me the importance of attention to details. I eventually got introduced to different departments across the business 
                    and decided to develop my skills in the Research and Development department.<br><br>
                    The team of 5 worked across the business researching for potential new systems to streamline the process flows. I successfully implemented a last mile delivery system which assisted in accountability and 
                    tracking of delivery drivers. With this in place, less errors in the financial side was made and a better, more thorough report was managed to be produced. This also increased the rate of deliveries to be increased by
                    about 30%.<br><br>
                    Furthermore, I went above and beyond to help the business succeed through assisting the marketing team on weekends during exhibitions to promote a new section of the business (Gobeli Store). During the toughest period of
                    COVID, I volunteered to do additional deliveries across the weekends to clear backlogs and also assisted on imports / exports when there was high volumes.

                <p>Whilst working for Globex, I still wanted to do work around swimming, therefore I established swimming classes with Gator Sports.<br><br>
                    Over the course of 2020 and 2021, I held swimming lessons to individuals of all levels from beginner to competitive swimmers and all ages. I was coaching swimming over the entire weekend and from time to time after work in Globex.
                    One of the clients that I attracted was Nina Juna (CrossFit Games athlete).<br><br>
                    A few successful lessons I had was with clients who were afraid of even dipping their head into water. Through personalised training and working thoroughly with them, they can now swim different strokes confidently in just 8 sessions.

                    The role taught and required me to be more detailed orientated instead of quantity. This was crucial when providing insurance letters, drafting emails as well as accurate investigations for internal reportings. I achieved a maximum of 
                    over 100 cases in a week, working only 3 days as a casual employee.
